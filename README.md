# Perturbation-Methods-in-Maple
This folder contains Maple worksheets, workbooks, and Jupyter notebooks containing code that supports the forthcoming SIAM book "Perturbation Methods using Backward Error" by myself and Nic Fillion.

The folder also contains several short Maple scripts for some standard perturbation methods, as described in my ACMES paper with Nic Fillion which you can find at [the Springer site](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-9051-1_3) or at [the arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01321).

Those scripts were originally provided in a Maple Workbook, which reads them in in a way so as to show their output.

The scripts are surprisingly easy to modify to solve other perturbation problems.

We have now written a book on the subject, and have added new scripts (each in its own subfolder, corresponding to a chapter of the book).  In particular, we have decided to include Jupyter Notebooks (with a Maple kernel).
We have also supplied the HTML exports from these Notebooks in some cases so that people can read them without having to install Jupyter.
