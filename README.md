# Perturbation-Methods-in-Maple
Several short Maple scripts for some standard perturbation methods, as described in my ACMES paper with Nic Fillion which you can find at [the Springer site](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4939-9051-1_3) or at [the arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.01321).

The scripts were originally provided in a Maple Workbook, which reads them in in a way so as to show their output.

The scripts are surprisingly easy to modify to solve other perturbation problems.

We are now writing a book on the subject, and are adding new scripts.  In particular, we have decided to move to Jupyter Notebooks (with a Maple kernel).
We also will supply the HTML exports from these Notebooks so that people can read them without having to install Jupyter.
