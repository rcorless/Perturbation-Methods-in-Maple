This seems like cheating, but it shows that errors in computing the integral can be interpreted as changes in the function all across the interval. More, it shows that the smallest possible change in the function (overall) is achieved with a constant.  \n",

That is, we have found the optimal backward error $\\| \\Delta f \\|_\\infty$, and an explicit function $f + \\Delta f$ which has that changed integral.\n",

    "We contend that it is helpful, or can be, and we will show some examples.  As to the second question, well, people are creatures of habit.  Moreover, when something works _well_, most people aren't inclined to look too closely at why. Finally, the standard theory of errors in computation of integrals works pretty well, and we haven't really needed anything different.  At least _one_ textbook, though, (Corless & Fillion, naturally) has discussed backward error and quadrature.  But we're not aware of any others, to be sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, though, in order to fit in with the rest of the book, we extend the backward error approach to the simpler problem of quadrature, and show that it works here too.  This will help to illustrate backward error on other problems, but also illuminate some things about quadrature that the standard theory (perhaps) doesn't show quite so well.  "
